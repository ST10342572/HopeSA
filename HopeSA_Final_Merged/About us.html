  <h1>Overview</h1>
  
  <p1>Hope SA Foundation is a well-established South African non-profit based in Johannesburg, Gauteng, 
    founded around 2000. Our mission is to empower underserved communities by addressing poverty, hunger, 
    education, healthcare, gender-based violence, and disaster relief. We align with the UN's Sustainable 
    Development Goals and use an "Each One Help One" approach to meaningful community support
</p1>

  <h2>Mission</h2>
  <p1>Our Mission is to equip educators and caregivers with the training and tools they need, 
    advocate for improved standards, and ultimately build resilient communities for a brighter tomorrow.
</p1>

  <h2>Vission</h2>
<p1>The Hope Foundation SA was established with one purpose in mind: to bridge the gap between the current 
    challenges faced by many ECD centres and the safe, quality environments our children need to flourish.
</p1>

<h2>What we do</h2>
    <li>Food & Water Security: Provide meals, filtered drinking water, and emergency food relief—often 
    feeding thousands during crises like floods, hunger emergencies, and winter drives.</li>
    
    <li>Education & Skills Development: Supply school supplies, towels, stationery, and life skills, 
    often on Exam season.</li>
    
    <li>Gender-Based Violence Initiatives: We launched the “Safer Women Drive” providing care packs, support, 
    and awareness programs in Johannesburg and KwaZulu-Natal.</li>
    
    <li>Disaster Relief: We help victims of floods and international crises like Earthquakes, Floods, Drought.</li>
